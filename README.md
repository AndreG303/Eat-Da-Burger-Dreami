# Eat Da Dreami Burger

I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will waiting to be devoured or you can save your burger for later.

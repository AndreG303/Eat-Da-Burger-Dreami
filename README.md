# Eat Da Dreami Burger

I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers you would like to eat.

## Usage 

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app let you pick between ready to eat or save for later. You can delete or move your burgers from ready to eat to I would eat again.
